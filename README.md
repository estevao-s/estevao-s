- Hey, my name is Estevão, I am from Brazil and I am an undergraduate student in Physics for Universidade de São Paulo (USP);
- I always liked to solve problems and that was one of the main reasons that I choose to learn more about Physics;
- Currently I work for a Asset here in my city as a stock analyst, and it was in this job that I started coding;
- I am basically learning how to code in Python for various reason, from Backtesting to FrontEnd Development.
